Hi, my name is AK47.
The software you are using now is called "WHafood".

It suggests food recipes for breakfast,lunch and dinner, currently you are using the first version of the software.

This software is extremely useful for those who are very busy and have no time to think on what to prepare for food, it saves a ton of time.

And if you don't know how to prepare the suggested food, there is a link to a youtube video for that recipe, it will be written as "Recipe Video(Lunch)",
it is available for both breakfast and lunch.

For dinner the only two options are Maggi and the same thing you ate for lunch,
now there is no link for maggi recipe because it is super easy to make :

Add 2 cups of water in a "CheenaChati".
Add the uncooked noodles(Break it into 4 pieces).
Add the masala.
Wait for some time while stirring.
Maggi is done!
